# Project Descriptions

## Git
Git is an open source content tracker for all sorts of programming projects. It works by implementing the concept of version control. Git has many functions that facilitate in accomplishing these goals which include ` push, pull, show, remote `, more can be found [here](https://github.com/ab344/miniproject1-601/blob/main/GitCommands.md). By having every developer have the full history of all the changes, it is very different to the usual scenario of having one single location for full version history. This allows projects to be finished in an efficient manner, while allowing creation of great documentation.
