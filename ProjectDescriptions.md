# Project Descriptions

## Git

* Git is an open source content tracker for all sorts of programming projects. It works by implementing the concept of version control. Git has many functions that facilitate in accomplishing these goals which include ` push, pull, show, remote `, more can be found [here](https://github.com/ab344/miniproject1-601/blob/main/GitCommands.md). By having every developer have the full history of all the changes, it is very different to the usual scenario of having one single location for full version history. This allows projects to be finished in an efficient manner, while allowing creation of great documentation. This allows a company to efficient manage programming project with great support as Git is open-source.

## Docker

* Docker is a virtualization platform to easily run containers. A container is a package which contains everything to run including the code and dependencies that can be easily moved, deleted or replicated across many types of machines without any regard to any configurations that might be stand out. This is a very efficient method for developers as they would have to worry about the site they would be using but rather have more time to focus on programming. A docker container's life is started with a docker image. The image contains critical information regarding what is needed to run like dependencies, tools libraries, etc. The docker hub is an open source repository to download or share one's own image. These image are then monitored and can be maintained by Kubernates or other similar programs. By using docker in a commercial scenario, it increases efficiency and saves time by have docker work out the compatibility issues and well as have Kubernates manage container to meet necessary requirements.

## Automated Testing

* Automated Testing is a software testing technique that tests and compares an actual outcome with an expected outcome. Many benefits stem from automating software testing including execution speed, test coverage, and increased effectiveness. Automating repetitive tasks in software is not only cost-effective, but time effective as well. 

The Automated Testing Process steps are as follows:

     1. Test Tool Selection
     2. Define scope of Automation
     3. Planning, Design & Development
     4. Test Execution
     5. Maintenance 

## Continuous Integration
